This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## About This Project

This is the first time I use Next.js to make something very interactive.
The design given shows a simple and look-easy design, but when I tried to implement it in to code, there a bunch of new challenge that I have never envounter before, this gives me a good meassurement on my skill level.

In this project I use everything I know to make the design into a reality.
I tried to use my way of layouting to achieve 'pixel-perfect' design on every browser and every device.
This project use `vw` unit instead of `px` or even `rem` and `em` for font-sizing. This can be done by utilising SASS programming capabilities.

The reason I use `vw` instead of `px` to aim 'pixel-perfect' product, is because every device comes with different dimension. Even a same device can be proven to have different size because of other factor such as zoom and DPI setting.

I'm quite happy with the result eventhough there are still many room for improvements on Next.js system.
